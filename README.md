## About me
Hello everyone! My name is Sanjana, and this is my portfolio.  
I enjoy exploring different types of data, finding insights, and presenting them with meaningful visuals.  

I have a background in Business Analytics and financial data analysis.  

You can see more information in my [RESUME](Resume.pdf).  

This repository was created to showcase my analytical and technical skills (Excel, Python, SQL, Power BI, R, and others).
